This is a puppet module for using a variable if it is defined, and otherwise not
doing anything with the variable.

Example:

file { "/path/to/foo.txt":
   mode => ifdefined('mode')
}

This will do nothing if an external nodes tool does not set $mode, and if it is
set, will use the mode, exactly as specified.

This is a shortcut around this syntax:

file { "/path/to/foo.txt":
   mode ? { 
      '' : undef,
      default : $mode
   }
}

This will allow the file to stay as set on the system unless explicitly set,
in other words.
